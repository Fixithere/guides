Security
========

A guide for practicing safe web.

Think
-----

Security is important, and you can't practice these guidelines without
understanding them. Question each guideline before following it yourself and
start a discussion whenever you're in doubt.

Passwords
---------

* Use a unique password for every account you create.
* Don't store passwords in plain text.

HTTPS
-----

* Use HTTPS for all web traffic.
* Use HTTPS in the beginning; it's harder to introduce later.
* Use HTTPS redirects for HTTP traffic.
* Use HSTS headers to enforce HTTPS traffic.
* Use secure cookies.
* Avoid protocol-relative URLs.

PGP and GnuPG
-------------

* Use a PGP signature in an email if you want somebody to trust that you wrote
  it.
* Use PGP to check email signatures if you want to know who wrote it.
* Use PGP to encrypt emails if you want to be sure nobody but the recipient is
  reading it.
* Use ultimate trust for your own keys.
* Use full trust for keys you have verified in person or via a secure video
  chat.
* Don't share your private key with anyone.
* Keep at least one backup of your private key and revocation certificate in a
  secure location.
